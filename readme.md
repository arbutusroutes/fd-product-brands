# FD Product Brands
* requires WooCommerce
A WooCommerce plugin that adds a custom taxonomy 'product_brand' to products and allows the attachment of images to the product_brand. Each image links to a search result for that taxonomy.

## Shortcode Usage
To use this shortcode, you can simply add `[product_brand_list]` to any post or page. You can also pass the `orderby` and `order` attributes to sort the list by weight, total quantity, or total retail value. For example, `[product_brand_list orderby="product_brand_weight" order="desc"]` would display the list of product brands sorted by weight in descending order.

## Changelog
* 1.0.1 - Initial testing and functionality. Integration of flickity JS and shortcode.
* 1.0.2 - Added autoupdate functionality, reorganisation of folder structure.
